Students will learn how scientific questions are developed; how logical and empirical arguments are constructed; the role of established theory in the development of questions; the general types of methods used to answer questions in psychology; and the range of professional and ethical issues and career opportunities involved in the investigation or application of psychological questions.  Emphasis will also be given to reading and searching the literature, and becoming familiar with oral and written forms of presentation in psychology. Prerequisite:  PSYC 100.",
