<h1>Weebly vs. Bootstrap</h1>

<h2>1. Ease of Access.</h2>

<h2>2. Easy to Make Changes/Updates.</h2>
<p>Weebly - 8 Bootstrap - 8</p>

<p>Weebly - Has buttons for easy drag and drop, and text boxes to update information.</p>

<br>
<br>

<br>

<h2>6. Easy to find help.</h2>
<p>Weebly - 8 Bootstrap - 10</p>

<p>Weebly - Didn't see an option to ask someone a question.</p>

<br>

<h2>7. Dependable Information.</h2>
<p>Weebly - 10 Bootstrap - 10</p>

<p>I completely trust the information/help/code provided by both Weebly and Bootstrap.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>8. Easy to read source information.</h2>
<p>Weebly - 5 Bootstrap - 8</p>

<p>Weebly - Hard to decipher which parts of the code are doing what.</p>
<p>Bootstrap - Fairly easy to read because I made changes and know what things do.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>9. Browsing Speed.</h2>
<p>Weebly - 6 Bootstrap - 9</p>

<p>Weebly - Pages takes several seconds to load/open.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>10. Professional Looking.</h2>
<p>Weebly - 7 Bootstrap - 9</p>

<p>Weebly - Difficult to make specific changes to streamline site appearances.</p>
<p>Bootstrap - Easier to make specific changes to make the page look professional</p>

<br>

<h2>Overall Preference</h2>
<p> Overall, I like Bootstrap better because I can make the changes I want when I want without any limitations on options.</p>
