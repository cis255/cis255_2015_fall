	<h1>1. Markup validation</h1>
		<figure>
		   <picture>
			  <source media="(min-width: 40em)"
			  srcset="images/EarthLarge.jpg 1024w, images/earthMedium.jpg 640w, images/earthSmall.jpg 320w">
			  <img src="images/earth.jpg" alt="Earth">
		   </picture>
		   <figcaption>An image of earth </figcaption>
		</figure>



	<h1>2. The main element</h1>
		<p id="notes"> notes the focus, of the main idea,concept, part of the page/article </p>
		<main> <!-- is a container for the main content of the page, or article --> </main>



	<h1>3. WAI-ARIA</h1> <!-- search menu // dosent work // but takes you to the root --> 
		<header>
		   <h1>Sub Title</h1>
		   <form action="/" method="get">
			  <input type="search"> <!-- opens a typeable form  -->
			  <input type="submit">
		   </form>
		</header>
		<ul>
		   <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <!--directs you to the root directory -->
		   <li><a href="/products">Products</a></li><!-- directs you to the root then up to products if it existed-->
		   <li><a href="/about">About</a></li><!-- directs you to the root then up to about if it exists-->
		</ul>
		<main>
		   <article>
			  <h1>Content title</h1>
			  <p>article/text content</p>
		   </article>
		</main>
		<footer>  <!--indicates a footer in the page  -->
		   <small>Copyright &amp;copy; Aurelio De Rosa 2014</small>
		</footer>

	<h1>4. The small element</h1>

		<img src="images/earthSmall.jpg" alt="London by night">
		<small>The copyright of this image is owned by Aurelio De Rosa</small>
		<p id="notes"> acts as a visible comment on the page to note captions or important info, by making text small </p>

	<h1>5. Subheadings</h1>
	
		<article>
	   <h1>
		   Main title
		   <span>This is a subtitle</span>
	   </h1>
	   <p>This is the content of this section</p>
		</article>
		<!-- this is a better way of organinzing information on a site by having the h1 as the title, 
			and using the paragraph tag to note the actual text, the article tag is more useful th the 
			web developer/designer then the actual customers viewing the page-->


	<h1>6. Images and accessibility</h1>

		<p id="notes"> the alt is mandatory on images but it is recommended to keep it an empty value as to not draw unnecessary <br/>
						attention to an element that was meant for aesthetics anyway.  </p>
						<!--the web site we are using for this assignment said that it was manditory so, i did too. but i tested section
							one where we used alt and images, by deleting it and nothing happend good or bad, so i dont know who to believe.-->
	<h1>7. The time element</h1>
		<time datetime="2014-11-06">6</time>-
		<time datetime="2014-11-09">9 November 2014</time>
		<!-- this is a good way to show a time range, though in the browser it only says "6-9 November 2014", and the 6-9 seems a bit lazy to me 
			 i would prefer to write "November 6 2014 - November 9 2014", just seems more profesional -->
		
		
	<h1>8. Meter and progress</h1>
		<p id="notes"> meter elements are good for percentages of a whole, meaning the maximum amount must be known ahead of time, while
					<br/> the progress element can be used to indicate that "progress" is being made, but no one knows the maximum amount</p>
	
	
	<h1>9. The longdesc attribute</h1>
		<img src="italy.jpg"
     alt="This image represents the map of Italy" longdesc="italy.html#description">

		<!-- the longdesc atribute is for extra explination and discription of an image, including a url link, instead of just a short caption -->

		<section id="description">
		  <h2>Italy</h2>
		  <p>The shown map of Italy illustrates its division 
		  in regions...</p>
		</section>

	<h1>10. The mark element</h1>
		<p id="notes"> see comments</p>
				<!-- the mark element is for highlighting specific text in a page, like SVSU or CSIS in every instance it is used.--> 


</body>
