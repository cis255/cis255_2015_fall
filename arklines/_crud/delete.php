<?php 
// Author: Allison Klinesmith
// Purpose: to test front end design with provided, back end code, and to test understanding of CSS and bootstra 
// Design:
//The specs are below.
//
//1. Copy the entire "_crud" directory recursively into your subdirectory. For example, after you position yourself in the correct directory, type "mkdir _crud" and "cp â€“R ../_crud01/* _crud". If you don't know how to copy files and directories in Linux, please learn this. This was supposed to be a prerequisite for this course. If you can't figure it out on your own, please come to my office hours ASAP!!!
//2. Inside the subdirectory, you will find 6 files with the extension, .php. You will NOT change database.php, but you will change the other 5 files. Change the HTML/CSS part of the code, not the PHP part of the code (unless you want extra credit). Use your own custom CSS/Bootstrap.
//3. Use relative referencing and absolute referencing when linking to external CSS files. Use double periods ".." in at least one of your references and put a numbered comment next to it so I can find it.
//4. Use in-line, internal (embedded) and external CSS.
//5. Use at least 20 Bootstrap classes and comment them to show you understand what they do.
//6. Use the "!important" attribute to override a Bootstrap class.
//7. Use at least one of each of the following: an ID selector, a CLASS selector, an ELEMENT selector, an attribute selector and a pseudo selector.
//8. Comment in your code at least one of each of the following: how your CSS execution is affected by (a) inheritance, (b) specificity, and (c) location.
//9. Add an image to each of the 5 files.
//10. Change all buttons to include appropriate glyph-icons.

	require 'database.php';
	$id = 0;
	
	if ( !empty($_GET['id'])) {
		$id = $_REQUEST['id'];
	}
	
	if ( !empty($_POST)) {
		// keep track post values
		$id = $_POST['id'];
		
		// delete data
		$pdo = Database::connect();
		$pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
		$sql = "DELETE FROM customers  WHERE id = ?";
		$q = $pdo->prepare($sql);
		$q->execute(array($id));
		Database::disconnect();
		header("Location: index.php");
		
	}
