            <h2 id="sun">Kerbol</h2>
            <p> The Sun is the most well known object in the daytime sky. Scientists have noted a particular burning sensation and potential loss of vision if it is stared at for long periods of time. This is especially important to keep in mind considering the effect shiny objects have on the average Kerbal. </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h2 id="mercury">Moho</h2>
            <p>  Moho figures in Kerbal mythology as a fiery place with oceans of flowing lava. In reality, however, it's much less interesting. 

Scientists speculate about possible ways to make it awesome like in the stories. Some of those ideas have led to new breakthroughs in aerospace technology.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h2 id="venus">Eve</h2>
            <p> Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. Its one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint. 

It is considered by some to be an almost sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures… Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are these people? </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h2 id="earth">Kerbin</h2>
            <p> A unique world, Kerbin has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans. Home to the Kerbals, it has just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable population of the eager green creatures. 

Reaching a stable orbit around Kerbin is one of the first things budding space programs strive for. It is said that he who can get his ship into orbit is halfway to anywhere. </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h2 id="mars"> Duna </h2>
            <p>Also known as the red dot that you can see if you squint at it really hard, Duna has long been a wonder to Kerbalkind. 

The planet has been held in much awe due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color green.  </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h2 id="jupiter">Jool</h2>
            <p> Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration. 

If you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy. </p>
            </li>
           
            <li>
            <h2 id="pluto">Eeloo</h2>
            <p>There's been a considerable amount of controversy status of Eeloo as being a proper planet or just a lump of ice going around the sun. The debate is still ongoing, as most academic summits held to address the issue have devolved into, on good days, petty name calling, and on worse ones, all-out brawls.  </p>

           <h3> Jebediah Kerman </h3>
           <div> (commonly just “Jeb”) is kerbonaut #0001, presumed owner of the rocket part manufacturer “Jebediah Kerman's Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.”, all-around badass, and one of “the original three”.</div>
       </li>
       <li>
           <h3> Valentina Kerman </h3>
           <div>the first official female kerbal and the first new kerbal on the initial roster after the original three. She is a pilot and has the "badass" flag. In common with other female kerbals (aka Kerbalinas), she has a smaller head than the men, wears a ponytail and has eyelashes.</div>
       </li>
       <li>
           <h3> Bill Kerman </h3>
           <div> kerbonaut #0002 and the least intelligent of the “original three”. He is an engineer. Like most kerbonauts with high stupidity, his facial expressions during flight tend to be less fearful than kerbonauts smart enough to ponder how many parts of their vessel are from toy companies and junkyards.</div>
       </li>
       <li>
           <h3> Bob Kerman </h3>
           <div> kerbonaut #0003 and the least stupid of “the Original Three”. Appropriately, he is a scientist. Bob has the least Stupidity of the original three but also the least Courage and does not have the "badass" trait to make up for it. Calling Bob "the smart one" might be overstating it, but Bob's personality traits cast him closer to the role of nerdy scientist than intrepid test pilot. </div>

    <h3>Takeoff Checklist</h3>

    <li>Make sure all kerbals are firmly attached to rocket</li>
    <li>Burning side goes down</li>
    <li>Don't let Bob drive</li>
    <li>Parachutes are on rocket</li>
