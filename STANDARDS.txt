CIS-255 Standards

all files must reside in directory...
/home/yoursvsuid/public_html/cis255
(that way files are linkable)

all file names must begin with yoursvsuid
(this will prevent conflicts when using github)

github commit messages must begin with "yoursvsuid:"
(to see who updated last version of files)
